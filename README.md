# R-Programming
## this repository contains the R file that contains two functions.
## The first function does matrix inversion and stores in the cache.
## The second function receives inputs from the first function, looks at the storred inverse matrix and takes that value.
## If the storred inverse matrix is NULL, it computes the inverse of the matrix.
